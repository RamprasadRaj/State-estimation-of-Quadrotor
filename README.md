# State-estimation-of-Quadrotor
Repository for all the MATLAB and Simulink files for state estimation of a X-configuration quadrotor.
## Objective
Implement state estimation of a X-configuration quadrotor using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) based on gyroscopes and GPS measurements in MATLAB and Simulink simulation. Study the performance of both the filter models in estimating the states of the quadrotor.

The process noise is modeled as Gaussian distribution, the noise in GPS and gyrosscope sensor measurements are modeled as Gaussian distribution as well.

The project report provides the obtained results with detailed explanation of the system dynamics and filter model.
